Moto Scroll Mini Project 🚀

Well… I might end up using this scroll way too much in my future projects… but hey, that's how we learn, right? 😅

This is a small project I built to practice and improve my coding skills, inspired by the amazing midudev and his 100 JavaScript Projects series ( https://www.javascript100.dev/ ). Highly recommended if you want to sharpen your frontend game! 👨🏻‍💻✨

I followed his tutorial as a reference, but this is my own interpretation — I’ve written the code my way, adding my personal touch.

Feel free to explore the project, fork it, or scroll endlessly until your internet gives up. 😉
